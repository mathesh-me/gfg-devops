## DevOps

### Traditional vs DevOps

### Traditional

- **Development Team** - Bussiness Requirements -> Application Code -> Store the Code in Github -> Notify the Operations Team 
- **Operations Team**  - Download the Code from Github -> Do some manual testing ->  Deploy the Application in the Server

- It Consists of two teams: Development and Operations
- **Development team** - They are responsible for developing the application
- **Operations team** - They are responsible for deploying the application

### How Traditional Works?

- Development team will develop the application code and they will store the code somewhere in internet like github. Then, they notify the operation team through email that they have developed the application code and they have stored the code in github. 
- Then, the operation team will download the code from github and they will deploy the application in the server. So, the development and operations team will work separately to develop and deploy the application.

### Disadvantages of Traditional

- It is a manual process. So, it is time consuming.
- It is a error prone process.
- It have more TTM(Time to Market). So, it is not suitable for fast growing companies.

### DevOps

- **DevOps Team** - Bussiness Requirements -> Application Code -> Store the Code in Github -> Do some automated testing -> Deploy the Application in the Server

- It Consists of only one team: DevOps team
- **DevOps team** - They are responsible for developing and deploying the application

### How DevOps Works?

- DevOps is methodology which combines the development and operations team into one team. So, the development and operations team will work together to develop and deploy the application.

- DevOps is a umbrella which consists of multiple tools. So, we can use these tools to automate the process of developing and deploying the application.

### Advantages of DevOps

- It is a automated process. So, it is not time consuming.
- It is a less error prone process.
- It have less TTM(Time to Market). So, it is suitable for fast growing companies.

### DevOps Tools

- **Git** - It is a version control system. It is used to store the code in internet. It is used to track the changes in the code.
- **Jenkins** - It is a continuous integration tool. It is used to automate the process of building the code. It is used to automate the process of testing the code. It is used to automate the process of deploying the code.
- **Docker** - It is a containerization tool. It is used to automate the process of deploying the application.
- **Kubernetes** - It is a container orchestration tool. It is used to automate the process of deploying the application. It is used to automate the process of scaling the application. It is used to automate the process of managing the application.
- **Ansible** - It is a configuration management tool. It is used to automate the process of configuring the application. It is used to automate the process of managing the application.
- **Terraform** - It is a infrastructure provisioning tool. It is used to automate the process of provisioning the infrastructure. It is used to automate the process of managing the infrastructure.
- **Monitoring tools** - Graffana, Prometheus, Nagios, etc. It is used to monitor the application. It is used to monitor the infrastructure.
