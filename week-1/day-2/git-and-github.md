## Git and GitHub:
- Git is a version control system.
- GitHub is a cloud based service that hosts Git repositories.
- GitHub is a Centralized Version Control System.
- We can use both Git and GitHub to track changes in our code.

### Git
- We can use Git to track changes in our code.
- We can install git and use it locally.

### .git folder
- When we initialize git in a folder, it will create a .git folder.
- Initialization means running `git init` command.
- If we want git to track changes in a folder, we have to initialize git in that folder.
- .git folder contains all the information about the changes that we made in our code.

### Git Commands
- **git init** :  It is used to initialize git in a folder.
- **git status** : It is used to check the status of the git.
- **git add** : It is used to add the files to the staging area.
- **git commit** : It is used to commit the changes.
- **git log** : It is used to check the commit history.
- **git reset <commit-id>** : It is used to reset the code to the previous commit.
- **git checkout <commit-id>** : It is used to switch between commits.
- **git diff** : It is used to check the difference between the current code and the previous code.
- **git checkout <branch-name>** : It is used to switch between branches.
- **git branch <branch-name>** : It is used to create a new branch.
- **git merge <branch-name>** : It is used to merge the branch with the master branch.
- **git clone <repo-url>** : It is used to clone a repository from GitHub.
- **git remote add origin <repo-url>** : It is used to add a remote repository.
- **git push origin <branch-name>** : It is used to push the code to the remote repository.
- **git pull origin <branch-name>** : It is used to pull the code from the remote repository.

### GitHub
- We can use GitHub to host our code, collaborate with others and track changes in our code.
- We can also use GitHub to deploy our code.

### Authentication in GitHub
- We can use HTTPS or SSH to authenticate with GitHub.
- For HTTPS, we have to enter our username and password everytime we push the code to GitHub.
- For SSH, we have to generate SSH key and add it to GitHub.
- We can generate SSH key using `ssh-keygen` command.

### GitKraken
- It is a GUI tool for Git.
- We can use it to visualize the changes, branches and commits.
